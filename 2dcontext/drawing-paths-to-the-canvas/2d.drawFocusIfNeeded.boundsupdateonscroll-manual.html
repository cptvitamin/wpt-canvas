    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This test has a lot of content before and after the canvas. To perform this test, tab to the first text link, then tab to the focusable fallback content in the canvas (this should also result in a visible focus indicator on a square in the canvas). Use an accessibility API inspector to note the location of the bounding rectangle of the focused element.  Scroll the window so that the canvas moves to a new location.  Use an accessibiliy API inspector to note the bounding rectangle of the focused element. This test passes if the location of the bounding rectangle updates to the focused element's new location on screen.</p>

    <p>"Don't, dear!" said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine.</p>

    <p>"Poor Ogilvy!" I said. "To think he may be lying dead there!"</p>

    <p>My wife at least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.</p>

    <p>"They may come here," she said again and again.</p>

    <p>I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.</p>

    <p>"They can scarcely move," I said.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen or far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars. The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies. And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.</p>

    <p>But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders. With wine and food, the confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring my wife, I grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.</p>

    <p>"They have done a foolish thing," said I, fingering my wineglass. "They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror. Perhaps they expected to find no living things--certainly no intelligent living things."</p>
