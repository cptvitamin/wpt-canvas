    <h1>Description</h1>
<h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Expected Result: A hit region is associated with each control and id in a hit region list and each is associated with the respective control in fallback content.  However, since there is no API to enumerate the hit region list, canvas mouse events received must have a matching id corresponding to the respective region with the id matching location touched by the mouse pointer. Each hit region must must be exposed as a best fit rectangle in screen coordinates in the platform accessibility API implementation for the corresponding fallback elements.</p>

<p>The test file should set up a hit region for each fallback element using addHitRegion with an associated id and the corresponding fallback element represented by the control at load time. The test file should print out mouse events associated with the id in an area outside the canvas element. </p>
